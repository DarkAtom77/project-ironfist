This the beginning of an idea for a random map-generator that bases maps off a "balanced" map structure. Essentially, it creates a random map-structure, then estimates both players' chances of winning in a simple Risk-like game called Force. See proto_rmg.pdf for more information.

This was developed by Zachary Sparks, a computer science grad student at Indiana who owed Darmani 6 hours of work, and payed it off with this.

This is far-future planning. We won't be using this for a while.
