Use this space to package resources into ironfist.agg .

Simply place the files you want into the ironfist_agg folder, and then drag-and-drop the folder onto H2AggPack.exe (in the tools/agg/bin directory). 

Some people have had problems when doing the above. Try instaed copying H2AggPack.exe into this folder, and running pack.bat . (Advanced users can add the tools/agg/bin folder to the "PATH" environmental variable instead of copying H2AggPack.exe here.)
