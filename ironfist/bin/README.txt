Copy ironfist.exe to the Heroes II folder. Copy ironfist.agg to the Heroes II/DATA folder.

This is a proof-of-concept version. Kobolds are currently the only addition. They can be found in the KoboldTest map (see the maps folder). They will act oddly, as the animation metadata is currently incorrect.

Some people have had trouble running Heroes II (and hence, also Project Ironfist) on Windows Vista and Windows 7 ( see http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_other-gaming/heroes-of-might-and-magic-ii-problems-with-64bit/acfc0bca-8184-4d9f-98a5-3235f23a8036?page=1 ). These problems should usually be solvable by ensuring that all DLLs are in their proper location (including wing32.dll, which is not included in newer versions of Windows), and possibly running in compatibility mode.
